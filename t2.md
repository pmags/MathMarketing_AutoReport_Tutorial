# How to dynamically generate Corporate Reports from Notebooks - Part II
*Creating a pdf template and style*

On the first part of this tutorial we layed out the projects basic struture and elements that we desire to include on the final output. On this second part we will go into greater detail on how some elements will be included on the final PDF report.

By the end of this second part our report will have:

- A cover including a title and subtitle which depends on the subject and can be changed inside the Notebook;
- A preamble where some concepts about the digital IQ are explan and that will be reused on similar reports (in some use cases it makes sense to include a small presentation or introduction); 
- Several graphical elements which are part of brand identify like footers or headers and can be changed directly from the notebook;
- Some custom elements which can be used when needed and are called using functions directly from inside the notebook.

Our target is reduce or remove output formating so that the Notebook user can focus solely on data analysis. To that end, we will need to include aditional elements to the Notebook setup with instructions regarding its subsquent output.

We will use Rmarkdow <link> as a Notebook and the final output will be a PDF report. Because we are using R the user needs to make sure that knitr and pandoc packages are installed. 

Markdown was originaly designed to be exported into HTML and has, since its release, evolved into acpeting other forms of convertion. In order to generate a pdf report we will be using pandoc <link> and LaTeX <link>, therefore we need to understand how this different elements interact together.

**Before we start we remind that this tutorila illustrates a potential approached and is by no means exautive. For the purpose of conveting an idea ot technic some overengineering might be included.**

## What is Latex

LaTeX is a document preparation system which is often used for making books or highly technical mathematical articles. LaTeX is well-suited for expressing mathematical formulas on electronic devices in a more human readable format by allowing them to be shown in a format similar to how they would be written in many textbooks or by hand and therefore is widely used on academic world. 

LaTeX is a typesetting system <link https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typesetting>, it uses source code to generate a document in contrast to word editors like Microsoft Word where what you see is what you get. Despite the steep learning curve, it adds brings greater control over the convertion which guarantees consistency and allows very complex outputs.  

In case the user opts to use Rstudio the necessary packages knitr and pandoc will have been already installed and available and he can already convert notebooks into HTML or DOC files. In order to export as a PDF file, it is required that LaTeX be installed. We suggest following the instructions found on the book *"Rmarkdown: The definitive Guide"* <link https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/installation.html> and install **tinitex ** <link https://yihui.org/tinytex/> 

```r
install.packages("tinytex")
tinytex::install_tinytex()  # install TinyTeX
```
> TinyTeX is a lightweight, portable, cross-platform, and easy-to-maintain LaTeX distribution. The R companion package tinytex (Xie 2019e) can help you automatically install missing LaTeX packages when compiling LaTeX or R Markdown documents to PDF, and also ensures a LaTeX document is compiled for the correct number of times to resolve all cross-references. If you do not understand what these two things mean, you should probably follow our recommendation to install TinyTeX, because these details are often not worth your time or attention. [Rmarkdown: The definitive Guide]

## Notebook header

All information about the notebook output is included on his header which is written in YAML <link wikipedia>. When the user runs `rmarkdown::render()` (or uses the knitr button in RStudio) it will look into the configuration instructions included on the header. Lets breake down our Notebook header:  

```yaml

---
title: "QiDigital_FitnessMarket"
output: 
  pdf_document:
    latex_engine: xelatex
    includes:
      in_header: latex/MathStyle.sty
      before_body: latex/before_body.tex
      after_body: latex/after_body.tex
    template: latex/MathTemplate.tex
geometry: margin=2.5cm
documentclass: article
subparagraph: yes
pdf-cover-image: "images/mathCover.pdf"
report-title: "How fit is your marketing?"
report-subtitle: "Portuguese Fitness Industry" 
footer-image: images/footer.png
---

```
The second argument of this function is the output format, which in our case is a pdf_document. The user can have multiple output formats simultaneously allowing for a greater degree of flexibility. When rendered, if no option is chosen then it will use the first option that is included on YAML metadata. By default, if no output information is included, Rmarkdown renders to HTML.

The user can pass aditional option which will change the pdf output (behare of the correct indentention). In our case we pass the following aditional options:
Dynamic
- *latex_engine*: on our case we will be generating using the XeLaTeX engine. The user can learn more about XeLateX here <https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/XeLaTeX>. LaTeX engines are behind the scope of this tutorial but suffice is to say that we will be using XeLaTeX in order to extend the available fonts 
- *includes: / in_header*: this elements allow us to introduce LaTeX which will be used through out the entire document. Because we plan to extensively manipulate our output we will use a Latex style document which gather all the major transformation  

s. Alternatively we could have passed intructions directly into YAML metadata or into the notebook. The following code includes a LaTeX package:

```yaml
---
title: "QiDigital_FitnessMarket"
header_includes:
  - \usepackage{pdfpages} 
output: 
  pdf_document
---
```
What this codes does is to change the default template by adding a line. It is important for the reader to know about this option but it defeats our purpose of reducing the impact of formating to a minimum on the Notebook.

- *includes: / before_body*: this element allows the introduction of a LaTeX file before the main body of our report (which is the notebook). We will use this option to include our preamble
- *includes: / after_body*: similar to before body, it allows to introduce elements after the report main body. We will use this for the back cover.
- *template*: this element allows us to include a custom latex template. In our case we will use this elements to include small changes to the standard template.
 
Advanced LaTeX user may argue that for on our case it would be redundant to include both a new template and a LaTeX style file. In fact, some if not all the necessary transformations could have been using either files and therefore avoiding the need for two separate files. Because we are accessing LaTeX indirectly through the Rmarkdown package we opt to use the same template as shipped with the package in order to avoid any breakdown during rendering.

The remaining elements included on the header include LaTeX package option which will be discussed later.

## Adding the cover page cover page

Branding is an important matter when issuing reports which might be read by the general public as is our case. Chances are that a brand manual and communication guidelines are in place to which every peace of communication shall comply. It is probable that in many cases, some of those elements are already prepared and ready to use.

LaTeX is indeed a very powerfull and flexible tool which allows quite complex outputs. Therefore would be possible to generate a cover similar to the desired one using solely LaTeX. We will use an alternative approach and import a pdf with a cover template and add a title and subtitle on top.

A package is a file or collection of files containing extra LaTeX commands and programming which add new styling features or modify those already existing. There are two main file types: class files with .cls extension, and style files with .sty extension. There may be ancillary files as well. When you try to typeset a document which requires a package which is not installed on your system, LaTeX will warn you with an error message that it is missing. You can download updates to packages you already have (both the ones that were installed along with your version of LaTeX as well as ones you added). There is no limit to the number of packages you can have installed on your computer (apart from disk space!), but there is a configurable limit to the number that can be used inside any one LaTeX document at the same time, although it depends on how big each package is. In practice there is no problem in having even a couple of dozen packages active.

Most LaTeX installations come with a large set of pre-installed style packages, so you can use the package manager of the TeX distribution or the one on your system to manage them. See the automatic installation. But many more are available on the net. The main place to look for style packages on the Internet is CTAN. 

If you are using TinyTeX as your LaTeX distribution, we recommend that you run tinytex::tlmgr_install("pdfcrop") to install the LaTeX package pdfcrop. If using tinytext as suggested before it will detect missing packages and install them

Base LaTeX offers a variety of functions to generate documents, packages allow us to expand on those funcionalities. Importing a pdf file into a latex document requires the use of the `pdfpages` <link> package. All packages must be included in the preamble. The following generic code imports a pdf into a LaTeX document:

```latex
\documenclass{article}

% imports package
\usepackage{pdfpages}

\begin{document}
% imports a pdf found on path
\includespdf{file_path.pdf}
```
However we are not running directly a LaTeX file, instead we are compiling a R Markdown file into a pdf using a LaTeX engine. In order to achieve that knitr uses a LaTeX template included with the package and we will modify it. This is the only modification we will make to the template file, all other custom LaTeX code will live on our style file including the call to any aditional package.

```latex
% the following code should be included on your style document:
\usepackage{pdfpages}
\usepackage{tikz}
\usepackage{graphicx}

% on the template just before the \title page the following code should be included
begin{document}
$if(pdf-cover-image)$
$if(report-title)$
\NoBgThispage %does not apply background
\includepdf[pagecommand={\begin{tikzpicture}[remember picture, overlay] 
                            \node [scale=6, text width=3cm] at (8.2,-4) {\textbf{$report-title$}};
                            \node [scale=3, text width=4cm] at (5.2,-7.5) {\itshape{$report-subtitle$}};
                         \end{tikzpicture}}]{$pdf-cover-image$}
$endif$
$endif$
```
With this peace of code we are altering the document structure by including a cover before the first page. The if statements make the inclusion of this part conditional to a path to a pdf to be used as cover and to a report tile. Please notice that both *pdf-cover-image* and *report-title* are both included in the notebook header and are used to specify this variables.

The title is added as an image on top of the new imported pdf file. The title and subtitle position is given and should be changed according to user needs. If the user whichs to let this be defined inside the Notebook he can substitute the absolute position into a variable like (8.2,-4) > ($x$,$y$)

## The back cover

The back cover is just a simple latex file saved as after_body.tex with the following code:

```latex
% adds a new page to the document
\newpage

% fills blank space and desables all style formats used on the document
~\vfill
\thispagestyle{empty}
\NoBgThispage

% adds text with color according to style guidelines
